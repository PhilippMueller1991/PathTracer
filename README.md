# PathTracer
Custom WIP PathTracer

Private Project: 
Implementing a raytracer from scratch only using papers, slides and math publications. 
The only libraries used in this project are the following:
- math.h: For sin and cos functions
- chrono: For accurate time measurements
- iostream: Console and image file output
- time.h: Random number generator
- vector: Dynamic arrays
- omp.h: OpenMP for parallelization on CPU

The github code can be found here: https://github.com/PhilippMueller1991/PathTracer

Note: The project is named pathtracer because I want to extend / transfer the raytracer to a pathtracer later on, when I am happy with the functionality of the raytracer.
